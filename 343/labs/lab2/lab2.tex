    Explanations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A Faculty 'can' be held by a campus, which is indicated by Faculty's partial participation in the Hold relationship, and an optional CampusID attribute.
        \item Since the attributes course\_code and session together forms the entity set Course's Primary Key, every entity in the set is a unique session of a course (e.g. CSC343 L9101).
        \item Emergency\_Contact is a weak entity set, which depends on Student's StudentID attribute to form its primary key.
        \item A Student 'can' be a Teaching\_Assistant, which is denoted by Student's partial participation in the IS A relationship. The SIN attribute of a Student is optional, but if the Student is a TA, then they inherits the SIN attribute from Employee.
        \item It is assumed that Professors must teach courses, thus the total participation in relationship Teach.
    \end{itemize}
