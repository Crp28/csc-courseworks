MIDTERM TEST QUESTION 1
Shell Usage

4 marks

We've provided a file in your midterm starter code called stats.txt.
It contains fake stats about athletes. We care only about the fifth column,
which is the number of games played for each athlete.

We want to sort the athletes by number of games played, from least to most,
and to place these sorted results in a file called sorted.txt.

Look at the man page for the sort program.

(A) 1 mark
Which option listed under Ordering options is the most appropriate
for helping you sort the fifth column? Briefly explain why this option is useful.

TODO short answer
The option -g might be useful as it compares according to numerical values.The fifth column contains only numerical values.

(B) 1 mark
Which option under Other options will help you actually focus on the fifth column?

TODO short answer
The option -k, or --key=KEYDEF, let sort to focus on a given location, in this case the fifth column.

(C) 2 marks
Now put it all together.
Write a shell command that sorts the athletes by number of games played,
from least to most, and places these sorted results in a file called sorted.txt.

TODO shell command
sort --k=5 -n stats.txt > sorted.txt
